          <h2>About the MOOC</h2>
          <p>
            Our digital marketing course explores the latest trends and developments, focusing on the opportunities
            and challenges faced by digital marketers. This short course introduces you to exciting new concepts and
            applications of digital marketing. It takes an informal “story telling” approach, encouraging you to share
            your own stories as consumers and/or marketers for the benefit of the learner group as a whole.
            We will focus on emerging trends in digital culture and online consumer behaviour, data analytics and
            privacy. Throughout the course, we examine the implications of these developments for both marketers and
            consumers.

          <h2>The Learning Experience</h2>
          <p>
            The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions,
            quizzes and activities based on your experience. You should be willing to reflect upon the ideas we will
            discuss in the context of your own experiences, and to share your stories and reflections with others on
            the course. You can create and share digital assets through interactive exercises and games and post a short
            video at the end of the course reflecting on what you have learned and how you will make use of the skills
            you have acquired.
